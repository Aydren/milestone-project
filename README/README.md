Reaction Speed Shooter

This game was inspired to me, by a game I would play prior to any shooter games on my PC. The game that I will be attempting to recreate is called "KavaaK's". KovaaK's is an aim trainer game where you can do different challenges to help improve youre aim with a mouse and keyboard. There are different challenges the game has to offer, but I would always find myself on the reaction speed challenges, as most of the games I played required you to react faster and more accurately than your opponent.

This game will feature my favorite of all the reaction speed games!

This particular game will spawn different orbs around the screen and your job is to hit as many as you can with the allowed time. Every hit will add 1 point, and every miss will also add 1 point. The purpose of the game is not to hit as many as you can in the allowed time. Its about hitting as many as accurately and as quickly as you can.

My particular version will offer 3 different difficulty levels that have a 30 second timer. Each difficuly spawns orbs at different speeds. Easy Mode will spawn orbs after ever 1.6 seconds, Intermediate every 1.2 seconds, and Hard every 0.8 of a second.
