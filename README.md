Reaction Speed Shooter

This game was inspired to me, by a game I would play prior to any shooter games on my PC. The game that I will be attempting to recreate is called "KavaaK's". KovaaK's is an aim trainer game where you can do different challenges to help improve you aim with a mouse and keyboard. There are different challenges the game has to offer, but I would always find myself on the reaction speed challenges, as most of the games I played required you to react faster and more accurately than your opponent.

This game will feature my favorite of all the reaction speed games!

The game will spawn different orbs around the screen and your job is to hit as many as you can with the allowed time. Every hit will add 1 point, and every miss will also add 1 point. The purpose of the game is not to hit as many as you can in the allowed time. Its about hitting as many as accurately and as quickly as you can.

Todo JS:
1. create a function that defines a 'div' with the 'class' of 'item'
2. create a Math function that will place our 'item' on the grid randomly
3: create a function that will make the make them disappear after how even much time is passed
4. we need to be able to create an 'onclick' addEventListener that will notify the 'item' that it has been 'hit'
5. we need to create a function that tell the game to add points once the item is 'hit'
6. add a 'miss' function to 'hit' so that we can see how many times you missed and hit the 'item'
7. create a timer that stops the game at after how ever many seconds/minutes
(bonus) create a pause screen
